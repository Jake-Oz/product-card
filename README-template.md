## My process

I followed a Next JS workflow to create the project shell, updated the Tailwind config file to include all the styles from the style guide. Then I created a Card component based on the mobile design using Tailwind styles. Once that was in place, I then added the styling for the desktop version.

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I learnt more about Tailwind CSS options on this project. The NExt JS component was fairly straight forward, the real key in this project was the CSS styling.
